<h1>P6: Feed Reader Test</h1>
<h1> Jose Lechuga</h1>

<h2> Project Specifications</h2>
<ol>
	<li>1. Edit the allFeeds variable in *./js/app.js* to make the provided test fail and see how Jasmine visualizes this failure in your application.</li>
	<li>2. Return the allFeeds variable to a passing state.</li>
	<li>3. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.</li>
	<li>4. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.</li>
	<li>5. Write a new test suite named "The menu".</li>
	<li>6. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.</li>
	<li>7. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.</li>
	<li>8. Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container. Remember, loadFeed() is asynchronous so this test wil require the use of Jasmine's beforeEach and asynchronous done() function.</li>
	<li>9. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes. Remember, loadFeed() is asynchronous.</li>
	<li>10. When complete - all of your tests should pass.</li>
</ol>
